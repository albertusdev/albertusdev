# Albertus Angga Raharja —— @adalberht
Hi there 👋 

My name is Albert and I'm currently a final year Computer Science major studying at University of Indonesia 🏫.
Throughout my 4 years of studies I've had the chances to intern as a software engineer in several top IT companies like [Google](github.com/google), [Gojek](github.com/gojek), and [Traveloka](github.com/traveloka).

At [Google](github.com/google), I joined [Flutter](github.com/flutter) team and created a cool feature called [Layout Explorer](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/inspector#flutter-layout-explorer) that helps people to understand Flex Layout in Flutter.

I'm currently in love with front end and UI-related engineering, with Flutter as my current favorite framework 😍

I'm a huge nerd and I love playing JRPG video games and watching anime during my leisure! ⚽
Also, I like to speed type and I can type around 150-160 word per minute on average. Hit me up on [TypeRacer](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/profile?user=adalberht) ⭐
